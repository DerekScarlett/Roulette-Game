Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

Link to project: ![roulette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36242561/38178230-3fc7552a-35dc-11e8-8a20-34e0c2c27e01.png)

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.JS, MongoDB

So with this app I used an epxress framwork that allows the user to play the game and keep track of when the user wins or loses. By pressing on the spin button that activiates click functions that allows pins to the DOM whether the user won or lost. Then it saves to the database the wins and loses totals.

Optimizations
If I had time to go back and work on this some more I want to be able to to track how much money the user bets and save the revanue to the database and then alerts the user on thier new total.

Lessons Learned:
I learned on how to manipulate the database and to find and update elements in real time.
